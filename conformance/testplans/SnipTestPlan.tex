\section{Introduction}

This note documents the procedure for testing an OpenLCB implementation against the
\href{https://nbviewer.org/github/openlcb/documents/blob/master/standards/SimpleNodeInformationS.pdf}
    {Simple Node Information Protocol Standard}.

The tests are traceable to specific sections of the Standard.

The testing assumes that the Device Under Test (DUT) is being exercised by other
nodes on the message network, 
e.g. is responding to enquiries from other parts of the message network.

\section{Required Equipment}

See the separate ``Installing the OpenLCB Test Software" document for initial installation 
and set up of the test program.

If a direct CAN connection will be used,
a supported USB-CAN adapter
    \footnote{See ``Installing the OpenLCB Test Software"}
is required. 
Connect the adapter to the DUT using a single UTP cable and connect two CAN terminators.

Provide power to the DUT using its recommended method.

\section{Set Up}
The following steps need to be done once to configure the test program:.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start the test configuration program. 
\item Select ``Set Up DUT".
\item Get the Node ID from the DUT\footnote{Where do we require this to be marked on a node?} 
\item Enter that Node ID into the program.
\item Configure the test program for the USB-CAN adapter's device address
        or the TCP hostname and port.
\item Quit the test program and reply ``Y" to "Save configuration?" when prompted.
\end{enumerate}

The following steps need to be done at the start of each testing session.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that the DUT is ready for operation.
\item Start the test program.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simple Node Information Protocol Procedure}

Select ``SNIP testing" in the test program, 
then select each section below in turn.  Follow the prompts
for when to reset/restart the node and when to check 
outputs against the node documentation.

\subsection{SNIP reply testing}

This section tests the format of the reply message in Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Standard.

It does this by issuing a Simple Node Information Request message, 
accumulating the reply(s), and then checking:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The message indicates its source is the DUT.
    \item The message indicates its destination is the testing node.
    \item The version byte at the start of the first section is either 1 or 4.
    \item The version byte at the start of the second section is either 1 or 2.
    \item There are exactly six zero bytes.
    \item Each of the six defined strings is no longer than its defined maximum length.
    \item There are no data byte(s) after the sixth zero byte.
    \end{enumerate}
